summary: Medium-Range GFS 10 Day Maximum High Flow Magnitude Forecast - Alaska
description: Depicts the magnitude of the peak National Water Model (NWM) streamflow forecast over the next 
  3, 5 and 10 days where the NWM is signaling high water. This service is derived from the medium-range GFS 
  configuration of the NWM over the Alaska domain. Shown are reaches with peak flow at or above high water 
  thresholds. Reaches are colored by the annual exceedance probability (AEP) of their forecast peak flow. 
  High water thresholds (regionally varied) and AEPs were derived using the 43-year NWM v3.0 reanalysis 
  simulation. Updated every 6 hours.
