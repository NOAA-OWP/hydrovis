summary: Medium-Range GFS 10 Day Peak Flow Arrival Time Forecast for Alaska
description: Depicts expected peak flow arrival times derived from the operational National Water 
  Model (NWM) medium-range GFS forecast. Shown are reaches that are expected to have flow at or above 
  the high water threshold over the next 3 and 10 days. Reaches are colored by the time at which 
  they are expected to be at their maximum flow within the forecast period. High water flows were 
  derived using a 40-year retrospective analysis of the NWM (v2.1). Updated every 6 hours.
