summary: Medium-Range GFS 10 Day Maximum Inundation Extent Forecast - Alaska
description: 'Depicts the inundation extent of the peak National Water Model (NWM) streamflow forecast for Alaska
  over the next 5 and 10 days where the NWM is signaling high water. This service is derived from 
  the medium-range GFS configuration of the NWM over the Alaska domain. Shown are reaches with peak flow 
  at or above high water thresholds. High water thresholds (regionally varied) and AEPs were derived 
  using the 40-year NWM v3.0 reanalysis simulation. Updated every 6 hours.'
