summary: High Flow Magnitude Analysis - Alaska
description: Depicts the magnitude of the National Water Model (NWM) streamflow forecast where the NWM is signaling high water. This service is derived 
  from the analysis and assimilation configuration of the NWM for Alaska. Shown are reaches with flow at or above high water thresholds. 
  Reaches are colored by the annual exceedance probability (AEP) of their current flow. High water thresholds (regionally varied) and AEPs were derived 
  using the 43-year NWM v3 reanalysis simulation. Updated hourly.
