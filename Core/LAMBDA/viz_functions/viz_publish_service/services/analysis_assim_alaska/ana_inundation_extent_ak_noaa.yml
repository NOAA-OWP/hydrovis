summary: Inundation Extent Analysis - Alaska
description: 'The map depicts the inundation extent of the National Water Model (NWM) streamflow forecast for Alaska where the NWM is 
signaling high water. Shown are sections of river with flow at or above a predetermined high water threshold as depicted in the "High 
Flow Magnitude - Alaska" service. High water thresholds (regionally varied) and Annual Exceedance Probabilities (AEPs) are derived 
using the 40-year NWM reanalysis simulation which is available via the NOAA Open Data Dissemination Program (NODD). Forecast inundation 
extents do not fully capture coastal processes. Updated hourly.'
