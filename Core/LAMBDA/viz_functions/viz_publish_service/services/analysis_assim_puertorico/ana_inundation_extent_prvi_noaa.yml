summary: Inundation Extent Analysis for Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands
description: 'Depicts the inundation extent of the National Water Model (NWM) streamflow forecast where the NWM is signaling high water. 
  This service is derived from the analysis and assimilation configuration of the NWM over Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
  Shown are reaches with flow at or above high water thresholds. High water thresholds and AEPs were derived from USGS regression 
  equations found at https://pubs.usgs.gov/wri/wri994142/pdf/wri99-4142.pdf. Updated hourly.

Estimated Impacted Buildings: Depicts building footprints that intersect inundation extents. The source of the building data is the 
FEMA USA Structures dataset: https://gis-fema.hub.arcgis.com/pages/usa-structures (as of August, 2022). Occupancy type data is only 
available for AL, CA, FL, GA, LA, MS, NC, SC, TX, and VA at this time. Also shown are a relative density heatmap of potentially 
impacted buildings (based on extent), and county level summary layers.'
