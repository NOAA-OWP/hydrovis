summary: High Flow Magnitude Analysis for Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands
description: 'Depicts the magnitude of the National Water Model (NWM) streamflow forecast where the NWM is signaling high water. 
  This service is derived from the analysis and assimilation configuration of the NWM over Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
  Shown are reaches with flow at or above high water thresholds. Reaches are colored by the annual exceedance probability (AEP) 
  of their current flow. High water thresholds and AEPs were derived from USGS regression equations found at 
  https://pubs.usgs.gov/wri/wri994142/pdf/wri99-4142.pdf. Updated hourly.'
