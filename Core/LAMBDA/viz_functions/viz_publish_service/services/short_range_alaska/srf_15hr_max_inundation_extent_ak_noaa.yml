summary: Short-Range 15 Hour Maximum Inundation Extent Forecast - Alaska
description: 'Depicts the inundation extent of the peak National Water Model (NWM) streamflow 
  forecast over the next 15 hours where the NWM is signaling high water in Alaska. This service is derived 
  from the short-range configuration of the NWM over the Alaska domain. Shown are reaches with 
  peak flow at or above high water thresholds. High water thresholds (regionally varied) and 
  AEPs were derived using the 40-year NWM v2.1 reanalysis simulation. Updated hourly.'
