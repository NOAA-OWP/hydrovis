summary: Short-Range 15 Hour Rate of Change Forecast - Alaska
description: Depicts expected change in discharge derived from the operational National Water 
  Model (NWM) short-range forecast over the Alaska domain. Change is computed between the current streamflow and that 
  expected over the next 15 hours at 3-hour intervals, and is only displayed for reaches that 
  are expected to have flow at or above their high water threshold. High water thresholds 
  (regionally varied) and AEPs were derived using the 43-year NWM v3.0 reanalysis simulation. 
  Updated hourly.
