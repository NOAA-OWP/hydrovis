summary: Short-Range 15 Hour Maximum High Flow Magnitude Forecast - Alaska
description: Depicts the magnitude of the peak National Water Model (NWM) streamflow forecast 
  over the next 15 hours where the NWM is signaling high water in Alaska. This service is derived from 
  the short-range configuration of the NWM over the Alaska domain. Shown are reaches with peak 
  flow at or above high water thresholds. Reaches are colored by the annual exceedance probability 
  (AEP) of their forecast peak flow. High water thresholds (regionally varied) and AEPs were 
  derived using the 43-year NWM v3.0 reanalysis simulation. Updated hourly.
