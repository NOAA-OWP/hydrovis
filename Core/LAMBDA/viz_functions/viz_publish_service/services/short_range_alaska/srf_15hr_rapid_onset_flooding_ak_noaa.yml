summary: Short-Range 15 Hour Rapid Onset Flooding Forecast - Alaska
description: Depicts forecast rapid onset flooding using the short-range configuration 
  of the National Water Model (NWM) in Alaska. Shown are reaches 
  (stream order 4 and below) with a forecast flow increase of 100% or greater within an 
  hour, and which are expected to be at or above the high water threshold within 6 hours 
  of that increase. Also shown are USGS HUC10 polygons symbolized by the percentage of 
  NWM waterway length (within each HUC10) that is expected to meet the previously mentioned 
  criteria. High water thresholds (regionally varied) were derived using the 43-year NWM 
  v3.0 reanalysis simulation. Updated every 12 hours.
