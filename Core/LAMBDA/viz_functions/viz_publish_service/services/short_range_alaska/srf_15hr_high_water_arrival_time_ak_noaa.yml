summary: Short-Range 15 Hour High Water Arrival Time Forecast for Alaska
description: Depicts the forecast arrival time of high water over the next 15 hours for Alaska. This service is 
  derived from the short-range configuration of the National Water Model (NWM) for the Alaska domain. 
  Shown are reaches that are expected to have flow at or above the high water threshold over the next 
  15 hours. Reaches are colored by the time at which they are forecast to reach high water. High water 
  thresholds (regionally varied) were derived using the 43-year NWM v3.0 reanalysis simulation. Updated hourly.
