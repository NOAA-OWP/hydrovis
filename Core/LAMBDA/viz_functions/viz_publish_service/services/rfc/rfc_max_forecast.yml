  forecast points with forecasts at or above action stage. Circles represent forecast points 
  where stages are changing by less than +/- 5% over the entire forecast period. Upward-pointing 
  triangles represent forecast points where a greater than 5% increase in stage is expected 
  sometime during the forecast. If stage increases greater than 5% are not expected, downward-pointing 
  triangles represent forecast points where a greater than 5% decrease in stage is expected 
  sometime during the forecast. Forecast points are colored by their maximum forecast flood 
  category. Updated every 5 minutes.
