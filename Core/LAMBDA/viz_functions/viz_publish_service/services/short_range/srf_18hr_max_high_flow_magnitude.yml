summary: Short-Range Maximum High Flow Magnitude Forecast
description: Depicts the magnitude of the peak National Water Model (NWM) streamflow forecast 
  over the next 18 hours where the NWM is signaling high water. This service is derived from 
  the short-range configuration of the NWM over the contiguous U.S. Shown are reaches with peak 
  flow at or above high water thresholds. Reaches are colored by the annual exceedance probability 
  (AEP) of their forecast peak flow. High water thresholds (regionally varied) and AEPs were 
  derived using the 40-year NWM v2.1 reanalysis simulation. Updated hourly.
