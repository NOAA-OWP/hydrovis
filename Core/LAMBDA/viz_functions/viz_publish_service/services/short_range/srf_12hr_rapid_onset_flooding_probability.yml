summary: Short-Range 12 Hour Rapid Onset Flooding Probability Forecast
description: Depicts the probability of forecast rapid onset flooding over the next 18 
  hours using a time-lagged ensemble from the short-range configuration of the National 
  Water Model (NWM) over the contiguous U.S. Shown are reaches (stream order 4 and below) 
  that are expected to meet rapid onset flooding criteria (flow increase of 100% or greater 
  within one hour and high water threshold conditions within 6 hours) using the most 
  recent 7 forecasts. Reaches are colored by the probability that they will meet or exceed 
  rapid onset conditions within hours 1-6, 7-12, and 1-12. Probabilities are computed as 
  the % agreement across the 7 ensemble members that a given reach will meet rapid onset 
  criteria at some point during the time period of interest. Hotspots show the average 1-12 
  hour rapid onset flooding probability, weighted by reach length, for USGS HUC10 basins 
  with greater than 10% of NWM feature length meeting rapid onset criteria in the next 12 
  hours. High water thresholds (regionally varied) were derived using the 40-year NWM v2.1 
  reanalysis simulation. Updated hourly.
