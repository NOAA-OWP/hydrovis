summary: Short-Range 18 Hour Peak Flow Arrival Time Forecast
description: Depicts expected peak flow arrival times derived from the operational National 
  Water Model (NWM) short-range forecast. Shown are reaches that are expected to have flow at 
  or above the high water threshold over the next 18 hours. Reaches are colored by the time at 
  which they are expected to be at their maximum flow within the forecast period. High water 
  flows were derived using a 40-year retrospective analysis of the NWM (v2.1). Updated hourly.
