summary: Short-Range High Water Arrival Time Forecast
description: Depicts the forecast arrival time of high water over the next 18 hours. This service is 
  derived from the short-range configuration of the National Water Model (NWM) over the contiguous U.S. 
  Shown are reaches that are expected to have flow at or above the high water threshold over the next 
  18 hours. Reaches are colored by the time at which they are forecast to reach high water. High water 
  thresholds (regionally varied) were derived using the 40-year NWM v2.1 reanalysis simulation. Updated hourly.
