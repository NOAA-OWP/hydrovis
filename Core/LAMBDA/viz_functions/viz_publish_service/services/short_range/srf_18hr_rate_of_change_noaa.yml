summary: Short-Range 18 Hour Rate of Change Forecast
description: Depicts expected change in discharge derived from the operational National Water 
  Model (NWM) short-range forecast. Change is computed between the current streamflow and that 
  expected over the next 18 hours at 3-hour intervals, and is only displayed for reaches that 
  are expected to have flow at or above their high water threshold. High water thresholds 
  (regionally varied) and AEPs were derived using the 40-year NWM v2.1 reanalysis simulation. 
  Updated hourly.
