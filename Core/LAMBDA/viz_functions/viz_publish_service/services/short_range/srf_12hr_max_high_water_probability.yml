summary: Short-Range High Water Probability Forecast
description: Depicts the probability of forecast high water over the next 12 hours 
  using a time-lagged ensemble from the short-range forecast of the National Water 
  Model (NWM) over the contiguous U.S. Shown are reaches that are forecast to have 
  flow at or above high water within the next 12 hours of at least one of the last 
  7 forecasts. Reaches are colored by the probability that they will meet or exceed 
  the high water threshold across the last 7 forecasts. Probabilities are derived 
  by counting the number of forecasts that meet the high water condition within the 
  next 12 hours, equally weighted. Also shown are USGS HUC10 polygons for basins 
  with greater than 50% of NWM features with flow expected to be at or above high 
  water over the next 12 hours, symbolized by the average probability. High water 
  thresholds (regionally varied) were derived using the 40-year NWM v2.1 reanalysis 
  simulation. Updated hourly.
