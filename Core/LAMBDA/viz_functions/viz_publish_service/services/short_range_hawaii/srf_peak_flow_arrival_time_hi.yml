summary: Short-Range Peak Flow Arrival Time Forecast for Hawaii
description: Depicts expected peak flow arrival times derived from the operational 
  National Water Model (NWM) short-range forecast for the state of Hawaii. Shown are 
  reaches that are expected to have flow at or above high water threshold flow over 
  the next 48 hours. Reaches are colored by the time at which they are expected to 
  be at their maximum flow within the forecast period. High water threshold flows 
  and annual exceedance probabilities were derived from USGS regression equations 
  found at https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2010/5035/sir2010-5035_text.pdf. Updated every 
  12 hours.
