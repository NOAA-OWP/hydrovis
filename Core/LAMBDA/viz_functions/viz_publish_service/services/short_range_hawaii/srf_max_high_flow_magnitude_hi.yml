summary: Short-Range Maximum High Flow Magnitude Forecast for Hawaii
description: Depicts the magnitude of the peak National Water Model (NWM) streamflow forecast over the next 
  48 hours where the NWM is signaling high water. This service is derived from the short-range configuration 
  of the NWM over Hawaii. Shown are reaches with peak flow at or above high water thresholds. Reaches are 
  colored by the annual exceedance probability (AEP) of their peak flow. High water thresholds and AEPs were 
  derived from USGS regression equations found at https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2010/5035/sir2010-5035_text.pdf. 
  Updated every 12 hours.
