summary: Short-Range Inundation Extent Forecast for Hawaii
description: 'Depicts the inundation extent of the peak National Water Model (NWM) 
  streamflow forecast over the next 48 hours where the NWM is signaling high water. 
  This service is derived from the short-range configuration of the NWM over Hawaii. 
  Shown are reaches with peak flow at or above high water thresholds. High water 
  thresholds and AEPs were derived from USGS regression equations found at 
  https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2010/5035/sir2010-5035_text.pdf. Updated every 12 hours.

  Estimated Impacted Buildings: Depicts building footprints that intersect inundation 
  extents. The source of the building data is the FEMA USA Structures dataset: 
  https://gis-fema.hub.arcgis.com/pages/usa-structures (as of August, 2022). Occupancy 
  type data is only available for AL, CA, FL, GA, LA, MS, NC, SC, TX, and VA at this 
  time. Also shown are a relative density heatmap of potentially impacted buildings 
  (based on extent), and county level summary layers.'
