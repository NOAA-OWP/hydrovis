summary: Short-Range High Water Arrival Time Forecast for Hawaii
description: Depicts the forecast arrival time of high water over the next 48 hours. 
  This service is derived from the short-range configuration of the National Water Model 
  (NWM) over Hawaii. Shown are reaches that are expected to have flow at or above the 
  high water threshold over the next 48 hours. Reaches are colored by the time at which 
  they are forecast to reach high water. High water flows were derived from USGS regression 
  equations found at https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2010/5035/sir2010-5035_text.pdf. Updated 
  every 12 hours.
