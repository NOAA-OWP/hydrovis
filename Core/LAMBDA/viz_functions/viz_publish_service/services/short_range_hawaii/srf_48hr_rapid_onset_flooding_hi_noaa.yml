summary: Short-Range 48 Hour Rapid Onset Flooding Forecast for Hawaii 
description: Depicts forecast rapid onset flooding using the short-range configuration 
  of the National Water Model (NWM) for the state of Hawaii. Shown are reaches 
  (stream order 4 and below) with a forecast flow increase of 100% or greater within an 
  hour, and which are expected to be at or above the high water threshold within 6 hours 
  of that increase. Also shown are USGS HUC10 polygons symbolized by the percentage of 
  NWM waterway length (within each HUC10) that is expected to meet the previously mentioned 
  criteria. High water threshold flows 
  and annual exceedance probabilities were derived from USGS regression equations 
  found at https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2010/5035/sir2010-5035_text.pdf. Updated every 
  12 hours.
