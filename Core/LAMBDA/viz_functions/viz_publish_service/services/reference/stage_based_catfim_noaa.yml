summary: Depicts flood inundation extents derived from official NWS category thresholds and the Height 
  Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) technique. Official stage thresholds are used.
description: 'Depicts flood inundation extents derived from official NWS category thresholds and the 
  Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) technique. Official stage thresholds (converted to water 
  surface elevation) are used. Flood inundation maps are colored according to their category. Mapping 
  extends 5 miles upstream and downstream of AHPS gage locations for streams of consistent stream 
  order. Not all sites are mapped due to incomplete or unacceptable gage characteristics such as 
  altitute accuracy, datum method, etc. (this information is available in the attributes table for 
  the "sites" layer. This is a static service and not a forecast service.'
