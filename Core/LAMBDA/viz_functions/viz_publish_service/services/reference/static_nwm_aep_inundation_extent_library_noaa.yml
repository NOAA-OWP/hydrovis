service: static_nwm_aep_inundation_extent_library_noaa
summary: Depicts flood inundation extents derived from NWM high water threshold, annual exceedance 
  probabilities and the Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) technique.
description: Depicts the inundation extent of the National Water Model (NWM) high water threshold and 
  annual exceedance probabilities. High water thresholds (regionally varied) and AEPs were derived 
  using the 40-year NWM v2.1 reanalysis simulation. This is a static service and not a forecast service.
