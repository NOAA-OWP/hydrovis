summary: Depicts flood inundation extents derived from official NWS category thresholds and the Height Above Nearest 
  Drainage (HAND) technique. Official threshold discharges are used.
description: 'Depicts flood inundation extents derived from official NWS category thresholds and the Height 
  Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) technique. Official threshold discharges are used for Action, Minor, Moderate, 
  Major, and Record. Not all threshold values are available for all sites. The threshold is the lowest value 
  in the range of values for a flood category. For example, if \"Action\" begins at 915.3 CFS and ends at 
  1120.5 CFS, then 915.3 CFS will be the utilized discharge value in mapping. Flood inundation maps are 
  colored according to their category. Mapping extends 5 miles upstream and downstream of AHPS gage locations 
  for streams of consistent stream order. This is a static service and not a forecast service.'
