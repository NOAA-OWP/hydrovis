summary: Medium-Range GFS 10 Day Rapid Onset Flooding Forecast
description: Depicts forecast rapid onset flooding using the medium-range GFS configuration of the 
  National Water Model (NWM) over the contiguous U.S. Shown are reaches (stream order 4 and below) 
  with a forecast flow increase of 100% or greater within 3 hours, and which are expected to be 
  at or above the high water threshold within 6 hours of that increase (all calculated in 3 hour 
  increments). Also shown are USGS HUC08 polygons symbolized by the percentage of NWM waterway 
  length (within each HUC08) that is expected to meet the previously mentioned criteria. High 
  water thresholds (regionally varied) were derived using the 40-year NWM v2.1 reanalysis 
  simulation. Updated every 6 hours.
