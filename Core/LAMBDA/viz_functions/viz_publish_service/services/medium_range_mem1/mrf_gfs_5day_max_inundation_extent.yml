summary: Medium-Range GFS 5 Day Max Inundation Extent Forecast
description: 'Depicts the inundation extent of the peak National Water Model (NWM) streamflow forecast 
  over the next 5 days where the NWM is signaling high water. This service is derived from 
  the medium-range GFS configuration of the NWM over the contiguous U.S. Shown are reaches with peak flow 
  at or above high water thresholds. High water thresholds (regionally varied) and AEPs were derived 
  using the 40-year NWM v2.1 reanalysis simulation. Updated every 6 hours.'
