summary: Medium-Range GFS 10 Day Maximum Inundation Extent Forecast
description: 'Depicts the inundation extent of the peak National Water Model (NWM) streamflow forecast 
  over the next 3, 5, and 10 days where the NWM is signaling high water. This service is derived from 
  the medium-range GFS configuration of the NWM over the contiguous U.S. Shown are reaches with peak flow 
  at or above high water thresholds. High water thresholds (regionally varied) and AEPs were derived 
  using the 40-year NWM v2.1 reanalysis simulation. Updated every 6 hours.

  SRC Skill: Depicts USGS sites that have an official rating curve, symbolized by the "skill" of the 
  synthetic rating curve compared to the official USGS rating curve. Each point is symbolized by the 
  mean difference in Water Surface Elevation (WSE) between the two curves.

  Estimated Impacted Buildings: Depicts building footprints that intersect inundation extents. The source 
  of the building data is the FEMA USA Structures dataset: https://gis-fema.hub.arcgis.com/pages/usa-structures 
  (as of August, 2022). Occupancy type data is only available for AL, CA, FL, GA, LA, MS, NC, SC, TX, 
  and VA at this time. Also shown are a relative density heatmap of potentially impacted buildings 
  (based on extent), county, and HUC level summary layers.'
