summary: Medium-Range GFS 5 Day Rapid Onset Flooding Probability Forecast
description: Depicts the probability of forecast rapid onset flooding over the next 
  10 days using ensembles from the medium-range GFS configuration of the National Water 
  Model (NWM) over the contiguous U.S. Shown are reaches that are expected to have 
  flow at or above high water thresholds on Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, Days 4-5, and Days 
  1-5 using the 6 time-lagged ensemble members of the medium-range forecast. Reaches are colored 
  by the probability that they will meet or exceed rapid onset conditions on Day 1, 
  Day 2, Day 3, Days 4-5, and Days 1-5. Probabilities are computed as the % agreement 
  across the 6 time-lagged ensemble members, equally weighted. Hotspots show average 1-5 day rapid 
  onset flooding probability, weighted by reach length, for USGS HUC8 basins with 
  greater than 10% of NWM feature length meeting rapid onset criteria in the next 5 
  days. High water thresholds (regionally varied) were derived using the 40-year NWM 
  v2.1 reanalysis simulation. Updated every 6 hours.
