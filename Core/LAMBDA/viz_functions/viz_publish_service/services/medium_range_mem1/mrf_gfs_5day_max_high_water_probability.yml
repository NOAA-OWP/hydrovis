summary: Medium-Range GFS 5 Day Max High Water Probability Forecast
description: Depicts the probability of forecast high water over the next 5 days using ensembles 
  from the medium-range GFS configuration of the National Water Model (NWM) over the contiguous 
  U.S. Shown are reaches that are expected to have peak flow at or above high water on Day 1, 
  Day 2, Day 3, and Days 4-5, using the 6 time-lagged ensemble members of the medium-range forecast. 
  Reaches are colored by the probability that they will meet or exceed the high water threshold 
  on Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, and Days 4-5. Probabilities are computed as the % agreement across 
  the 6 time-lagged ensemble members, equally weighted. Also shown are USGS HUC8 polygons for basins with 
  greater than 50% of NWM features with flow expected to be at or above high water over the next 
  5 days, symbolized by the average probability. High water thresholds (regionally varied) were 
  derived using the 40-year NWM v2.1 reanalysis simulation. Updated every 6 hours.
