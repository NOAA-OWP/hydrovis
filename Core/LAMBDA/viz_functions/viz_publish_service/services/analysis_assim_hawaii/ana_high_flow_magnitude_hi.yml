summary: High Flow Magnitude Analysis for Hawaii
description: 'Depicts the magnitude of the National Water Model (NWM) streamflow forecast where the NWM is signaling high water. 
  This service is derived from the analysis and assimilation configuration of the NWM over Hawaii. Shown are reaches with flow at 
  or above high water thresholds. Reaches are colored by the annual exceedance probability (AEP) of their current flow. High 
  water thresholds and AEPs were derived from USGS regression equations found at https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2010/5035/sir2010-5035_text.pdf. 
  Updated hourly.'
