summary: Inundation Extent Analysis for Hawaii
description: 'Depicts the inundation extent of the National Water Model (NWM) streamflow forecast where the NWM is signaling high water.
  This service is derived from the analysis and assimilation configuration of the NWM over Hawaii. Shown are reaches with flow at or above 
  high water thresholds. High water thresholds and AEPs were derived from USGS regression equations found at 
  https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2010/5035/sir2010-5035_text.pdf. Updated hourly.

  Estimated Impacted Buildings: Depicts building footprints that intersect inundation extents. The source of the building data is the FEMA 
  USA Structures dataset: https://gis-fema.hub.arcgis.com/pages/usa-structures (as of August, 2022). Occupancy type data is only available 
  for AL, CA, FL, GA, LA, MS, NC, SC, TX, and VA at this time. Also shown are a relative density heatmap of potentially impacted buildings 
  (based on extent), and county level summary layers.'
