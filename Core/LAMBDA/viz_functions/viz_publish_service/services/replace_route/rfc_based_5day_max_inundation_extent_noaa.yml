summary: RFC Based 5-Day Maximum Inundation Forecast
description: 'Depicts maximum inundation extent over the next 5 days derived from the official River Forecast Center 
  (RFC) forecast routed downstream through the National Water Model (NWM) stream network. Maximum streamflows are 
  available downstream of RFC forecast points whose forecast reaches action status or greater. Updated hourly.

SRC Skill: Depicts USGS sites that have an official rating curve, symbolized by the "skill" of the synthetic rating 
curve compared to the official USGS rating curve. Each point is symbolized by the mean difference in Water Surface 
Elevation (WSE) between the two curves.

Estimated Impacted Buildings: Depicts building footprints that intersect inundation extents. The source of the 
building data is the FEMA USA Structures dataset: https://gis-fema.hub.arcgis.com/pages/usa-structures 
(as of August, 2022). Occupancy type data is only available for AL, CA, FL, GA, LA, MS, NC, SC, TX, and VA at 
this time. Also shown are a relative density heatmap of potentially impacted buildings (based on extent), 
county, and HUC level summary layers.'
