summary: Medium-Range NBM 10 Day Maximum High Flow Magnitude Forecast
description: Depicts the magnitude of the peak National Water Model (NWM) streamflow forecast over the next 
  3, 5 and 10 days where the NWM is signaling high water. This service is derived from the medium-range NBM 
  configuration of the NWM over the contiguous U.S. Shown are reaches with peak flow at or above high water 
  thresholds. Reaches are colored by the annual exceedance probability (AEP) of their forecast peak flow. 
  High water thresholds (regionally varied) and AEPs were derived using the 40-year NWM v2.1 reanalysis 
  simulation. Updated every 6 hours.
