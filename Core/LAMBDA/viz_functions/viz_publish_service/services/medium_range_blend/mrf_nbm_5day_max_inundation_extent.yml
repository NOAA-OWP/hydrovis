summary: Medium-Range NBM 5 Day Maximum Inundation Extent Forecast

<br><br>
*****THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL SERVICE*****
<br><br>
This experimental map represents the National Weather Service''s best approximation of inundation extent based upon modeled river discharge.
<br><br>
The map depicts the inundation extent of the peak National Water Model (NWM) streamflow forecast over the next 5 days where the NWM is signaling high water. This service is derived from the medium-range NBM configuration of the NWM for an area that includes 30% of the U.S. population but will be expanded later as described in the Story Map below.

<br><br>
Boundary of 30% Area: <a>https://maps.water.noaa.gov/server/rest/services/reference/static_public_fim_domain/MapServer</a>
<br><br>
Shown are sections of river with flow at or above a predetermined high water threshold as depicted in the following service:
<br><br>
<a>https://maps.water.noaa.gov/server/rest/services/nwm/ana_high_flow_magnitude/MapServer</a>
<br><br>
High water thresholds (regionally varied) and Annual Exceedance Probabilities (AEPs) are derived using the 40-year NWM reanalysis simulation which is available via the NOAA Open Data Dissemination Program (NODD). Forecast inundation extents do not fully capture coastal processes. The service below depicts the boundary of this coastal area.

This service is updated every 6 hours.
