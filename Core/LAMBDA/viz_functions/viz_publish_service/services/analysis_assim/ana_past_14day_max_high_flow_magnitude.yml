summary: Past 14-Day High Flow Magnitude Analysis
description: Depicts the magnitude of the peak NWM streamflow analysis over the past 14 days where the National Water Model (NWM) signaled high water. 
  This service is derived from the analysis and assimilation configuration of the NWM over the contiguous U.S. 
  Shown are reaches with flow at or above high water thresholds. Reaches are colored by the annual exceedance probability (AEP) of their maximum flow 
  over the past 14 days. High water thresholds (regionally varied) and AEPs were derived using the 40-year NWM v2.1 reanalysis simulation. Updated daily.
