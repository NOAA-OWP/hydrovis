summary: Inundation Extent Analysis
description: 'Depicts the inundation extent of the National Water Model (NWM) streamflow forecast where the NWM is signaling high water. 
  This service is derived from the analysis and assimilation configuration of the NWM over the contiguous U.S. Shown are reaches with flow 
  at or above high water thresholds. High water thresholds (regionally varied) and AEPs were derived using the 40-year NWM v2.1 reanalysis 
  simulation. Updated hourly.

  SRC Skill: Depicts USGS sites that have an official rating curve, symbolized by the "skill" of the synthetic rating curve compared to 
  the official USGS rating curve. Each point is symbolized by the mean difference in Water Surface Elevation (WSE) between the two curves.

  Estimated Impacted Buildings: Depicts building footprints that intersect inundation extents. The source of the building data is the FEMA 
  USA Structures dataset: https://gis-fema.hub.arcgis.com/pages/usa-structures (as of August, 2022). Occupancy type data is only 
  available for AL, CA, FL, GA, LA, MS, NC, SC, TX, and VA at this time. Also shown are a relative density heatmap of potentially 
  impacted buildings (based on extent), county, and HUC level summary layers.'
