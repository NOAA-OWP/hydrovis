summary: Short-Range Peak Flow Arrival Time Forecast for Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands
description: Depicts expected peak flow arrival times derived from the operational National Water Model 
  (NWM) short-range forecast for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Shown are reaches that are 
  expected to have flow at or above high water threshold flow over the next 48 hours. Reaches are colored 
  by the time at which they are expected to be at their maximum flow within the forecast period. High 
  water threshold flows and annual exceedance probabilities were derived from USGS regression equations 
  found at https://pubs.usgs.gov/wri/wri994142/pdf/wri99-4142.pdf. Updated every 12 hours.
