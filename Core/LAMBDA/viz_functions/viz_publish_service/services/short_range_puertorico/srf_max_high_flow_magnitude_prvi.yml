summary: Short-Range Maximum High Flow Magnitude Forecast for Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands
description: Depicts the magnitude of the peak National Water Model (NWM) streamflow forecast  
  over the next 48 hours where the NWM is signaling high water. This service is derived from 
  the short-range configuration of the NWM over Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
  Shown are reaches with peak flow at or above high water thresholds. Reaches are colored by 
  the annual exceedance probability (AEP) of their peak flow. High water thresholds and AEPs 
  were derived from USGS regression equations found at 
  https://pubs.usgs.gov/wri/wri994142/pdf/wri99-4142.pdf. Updated every 12 hours.
