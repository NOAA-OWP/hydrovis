summary: Short-Range High Water Arrival Time Forecast for Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands
description: Depicts the forecast arrival time of high water over the next 48 hours. 
  This service is derived from the short-range configuration of the National Water Model 
  (NWM) over Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Shown are reaches that are expected 
  to have flow at or above the high water threshold over the next 48 hours. Reaches are 
  colored by the time at which they are forecast to reach high water. High water flows 
  were derived from USGS regression equations found at 
  https://pubs.usgs.gov/wri/wri994142/pdf/wri99-4142.pdf. Updated every 12 hours.
