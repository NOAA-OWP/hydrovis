Probabilities are computed as the % agreement across the 7 ensemble members, equally weighted. Hotspots show average 1-5 day rapid onset flooding probability, weighted by reach length, for USGS HUC8 basins with greater than 10% of NWM feature length meeting rapid onset criteria in the next 5 days.

Reaches are colored by the probability that they will meet or exceed rapid onset conditions within hours 1-6, 7-12, and 1-12. Probabilities are computed as the % agreement across the 7 ensemble members that a given reach will meet rapid onset criteria at some point during the time period of interest. Hotspots show the average 1-12 hour rapid onset flooding probability, weighted by reach length, for USGS HUC10 basins with greater than 10% of NWM feature length meeting rapid onset criteria in the next 12 hours. High water thresholds (regionally varied) were derived using the 40-year NWM v2.1 reanalysis simulation. Updated hourly.'\n",

Metrics are computed through static comparison of benchmark maps to HAND maps at specific flow magnitudes (e.g. 100yr, 500yr, Action, Minor, Moderate, Major). Metrics reported are Critical Success Index (CSI), True Positive Rate (TPR) also known as Probability of Detection (POD), False Alarm Ratio (FAR), and Probability Not Detected (PND). Polygons and sites are symbolized by CSI by default; however, the other metrics (TPR, FAR, and PND) are available in the attributes for each location. For a description of how metrics are computed, see https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/inundation-mapping/wiki/Evaluating-HAND-Performance. Benchmark sources for HUC8 vary between FEMA Base Level Engineering, Iowa Flood Center, and RAS2FIM while benchmark sources for AHPS locations vary between USGS and AHPS FIM based on data availability at each HUC8 or AHPS location. Also, flow magnitudes used vary depending on the benchmark sources. Each feature represents the HAND FIM method skill metrics of unique benchmark data source and flow magnitude. This is a static service; it does not provide estimates of FIM skills in real-time.
