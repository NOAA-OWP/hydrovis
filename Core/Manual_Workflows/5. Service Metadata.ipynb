Metrics are computed through static comparison of benchmark maps to HAND maps at specific flow magnitudes (e.g. 100yr, 500yr, Action, Minor, Moderate, Major). Metrics reported are Critical Success Index (CSI), True Positive Rate (TPR) also known as Probability of Detection (POD), False Alarm Ratio (FAR), and Probability Not Detected (PND). Polygons and sites are symbolized by CSI by default; however, the other metrics (TPR, FAR, and PND) are available in the attributes for each location. For a description of how metrics are computed, see https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/inundation-mapping/wiki/Evaluating-HAND-Performance. Benchmark sources for HUC8 vary between FEMA Base Level Engineering, Iowa Flood Center, and RAS2FIM while benchmark sources for AHPS locations vary between USGS and AHPS FIM based on data availability at each HUC8 or AHPS location. Also, flow magnitudes used vary depending on the benchmark sources. Each feature represents the HAND FIM method skill metrics of unique benchmark data source and flow magnitude. This is a static service; it does not provide estimates of FIM skills in real-time. This service only shows the HAND FIM method skill as compared to benchmark maps produced for scenarios of specific magnitudes.'\n",
