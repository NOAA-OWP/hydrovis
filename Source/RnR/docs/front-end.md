# Front end Web Services

A web frontend will be set up as part of the Docker compose process, with the endpoint /frontend/v1/plot/, which can be accessed in a browser. This allows searching of all the PNG plot files and the Replace and Route NetCDF data generated by the API. First a LID needs to be selected. Then any files that fall within the date range selected by the user will display on screen, in a tabbed interface grouping them by feature ID, and then by forecast date. The search can be narrowed down to any date range desired (though result sets may take significantly longer to load for large date ranges or for LIDs with forecasts for numerous feature IDs). There is also a "Download Zip" option that will take the currently displayed result set and package it in a Zip file for the end user.
